# Logging and Metrics Checklist

Reference: [`../../kamae-scala/references/logging-metrics.md`](../../kamae-scala/references/logging-metrics.md).
Also see [`pii-protection.md`](./pii-protection.md) for redaction rules.

## 6.1 Are log messages meaningful? - Medium

Flag log messages that only name the method or contain no domain context.

A good log message describes what happened in business terms: `"driver assigned
to waiting request"` rather than `"assignDriver called"`.

## 6.2 Does each log include the affected domain object's state? - Medium

Flag logs that omit identifiers, current state variant, or decision-relevant
values. Structured fields should carry the aggregate or entity ID and the state
needed to reconstruct the event.

Prefer field maps or MDC over sentence interpolation.

## 6.3 Are state transitions logged explicitly? - Medium

Flag lifecycle changes that do not record both source and target state, or the
command/event that triggered the transition.

Look for missing `from`/`to` fields, missing event names, or logs emitted only
inside infrastructure rather than at the use-case boundary that owns the
transaction.

## 6.4 Are logs structured and level-appropriate? - Low

Flag string interpolation of whole entities instead of structured fields. Flag
verbose `INFO` logging in helpers or loops that should be `DEBUG`.

Check that `ERROR` logs indicate a real failure path and include enough context
to diagnose it without leaking secrets.

## 6.5 Are metrics tied to domain outcomes? - Low

Flag metrics that only count HTTP status codes, JVM thread counts, or generic
runtime values without a domain dimension. Prefer counters and histograms that
reflect business events and state durations, labeled with bounded domain values
such as state names or command names.

## 6.6 Is metric cardinality controlled? - Medium

Flag labels that use raw IDs, timestamps, email addresses, or unbounded strings.
High-cardinality labels can overwhelm time-series storage and leak identifiers
into metric backends.

## 6.7 Are PII and secrets kept out of logs, spans, and metrics? - High

Cross-check with `pii-protection.md`. Flag any log field, span attribute,
metric label, or error display string that carries raw sensitive values.

Also check that `toString`, redacting wrappers, and allowlists are applied
consistently before domain objects reach observability helpers.

## 6.8 Are logged IDs classified correctly? - High

Cross-check with the "Which IDs Belong in Logs" section in
`logging-metrics.md`. Flag identifiers logged by field name assumption rather
than documented safety.

Escalate when logs, spans, or metric labels carry:

- secrets, session tokens, or API keys
- government, payment, health, or contact identity values
- person-linked IDs that are not opaque surrogates (email-as-key, provider
  subject, reversible hash of PII)
- raw user/customer/passenger IDs as metric labels

Do not flag opaque surrogate aggregate IDs (`requestId`, `orderId`,
`correlationId`, internal `transactionId`) when the type's formatting is
reviewed and the value is not derived from PII.

## 6.9 Are error chains logged once with domain context? - Medium

Cross-check [`../../kamae-scala/references/logging-metrics.md`](../../kamae-scala/references/logging-metrics.md#integrate-error-chains-with-structured-logging). Flag duplicate error logs at every adapter layer for the same failure, or logs that stringify errors without domain fields alongside the cause.

## 6.10 Do error metrics use bounded labels? - Low

Flag counters or histograms labeled with raw error text, SQL fragments, or
unbounded strings instead of enum variant names or stable `errorCode` values.
